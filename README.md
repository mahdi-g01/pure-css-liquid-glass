# Pure CSS liquid glass simulation

In this code, I designed a pure CSS component, that simulate the effect of IOS liquid glass. 

![A video of overview from a pure CSS liquid glass.](pure-css-liquid-glass.gif)

The main trick here, is to use a thick, transparent ridge outline, behind the backdrop blur filter and inside the card, to distort the light behind the card. 
Not 100% liquid glass, but it is lightweight and no need to write JS file to manipulate pixels.

Support and share, it can get a lot better :)
